After commit 9c3a9a60
=====================
I thought about the impact of mutating 'raise' to 'pass' on my test suite. (mutant 7)
I have a couple of tests: test_input_none and test_input_empty which should have failed because they were expecting
exceptions to be thrown, and no exception should have been thrown.  I ran mutmut apply 7 then debugged test_input_none
and discovered that while the original exception was suppressed, a different runtime error was encountered on line 12
when trying to find the length of numbers, which was None for this test.

While there was no externally visible difference in behavior -- an exception was thrown in either case -- the exception
in the mutated case is being thrown for the wrong reason and I was lucky that my implementation caught it.  It would
be a better implementation choice to throw a more specific exception than Exception, and verify the more specific
exception in the test.

Also, wrapping the test in a pytest.raises(Exception) is just plain sloppy and bad practice since it will eat any
runtime error.

After commit 710ce10
====================
I implemented a more specific exception (EmptyInputException) to be thrown, and modified the tests to expect it rather
than a general Exception.
